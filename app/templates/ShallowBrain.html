            <h2>About ShallowBrain</h2>
            <p>ShallowBrain is a simple AI for the game of reversi. It was created for an AI reversi tournament at Southern University of Illinois: Edwardsville in 2016. The AI placed Second in the competition ðŸ¥ˆ. I found this code on an old harddrive and wanted to frakenstien it back to life. ShallowBrain uses an Algorythim called Alpha-Beta Pruning to find the best move.</p>

            <h2>What is Alpha-Beta Pruning?</h2>
            <p>Alpha-beta pruning is a technique used to make game-playing algorithms more efficient. It works by assigning board states a score and playing out multiple games each turn. It creates a search tree out of these games states. It then eliminates branches of the search tree that don't need to be explored, allowing the algorithm to search deeper in less time.</p>

            <p>This optimization help game engines like ShallowBrain make (sometimes) better decisions by considering more possible moves without drastically increasing computation time.</p>
