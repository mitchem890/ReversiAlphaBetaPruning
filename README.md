# ReversiAlphaBetaPruning
This is an old project. Takes in an 8x8 array of ints representing the gameboard. 1 representing its own piece and -1 representing the opponents piece.
```
{{0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
 {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
 {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
 {0,0,0,1,-1,0,0,0},
 {0,0,0,-1,1,0,0,0},
 {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
 {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0},
 {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}}
 ```
 
 It will return back the best possible determined move along with a percieved heuristic score
